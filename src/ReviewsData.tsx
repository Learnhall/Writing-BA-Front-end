He is a very great teacher and my girls are telling me that they really feel like they understand the concepts well for the first time. The biggest help has been that my oldest was really lacking in confidence in math, but now she looks forward to sessions with Mike. He has helped to build  her up, so that she is now able to focus on doing math only and not on how terrible she thinks she is at it. This has been a life saver for me! He's really skilled at facilitating different learning levels during shared sessions.`,

Mike took time to understand the learning style that worked best for my daughter and where she was missing information and process so that he could help course correct and guide her to the next level. My daughter takes her education seriously and Mike was able to help her reach her goal of achieving straight A’s. I highly recommend Mike as a tutor, he did not disappoint and we are eager to work with him again through the summer and my daughter’s Senior year! Thank you Mike, you saved the semester!!`,

He was always there to support me every step of the way with his one-on-one tutoring. I could not have asked for a better tutor. I have a learning disability, he was consistence, reliable, professional, experience and supportive.  His project, Learnhall, is a stepping stone that encourages people to strive in learning and excelling in a variety of  subjects.`

I was very apprehensive in believing that his program would be affordable for a tutor to come to my home, and that he would actually be able to find someone just the right fit for my son.  He did more than just that!  I am  blessed to have found this company that is run by someone so compassionate and serious about seeing other people's children succeed.  Val is the tutor that was hand-picked by him.  My son adoressssss her!  She's everything that I have prayed for.  My son opened up to her right away.  She's young, energetic, & knows how to engage with him to get him to open up, & it's wonderful to see him finally enjoying the learning experience because she  is both a good teacher and a fun teacher and it has made all the difference.`,

After the first session with a tutor my son was able to understand the concepts they were working on in class and his interest in the subject was renewed. My only wish was that we would have started sooner! The owner and tutors have been so great about working with our crazy busy schedule and working within our budget, cannot say enough great things about them!

We will be engaging this team of tutors for the duration of our children’s education.`,
